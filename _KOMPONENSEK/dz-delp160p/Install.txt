Delphi Zip
Version 1.6p beta

NEW: Now supports Delphi 6!

If you already have an earlier version installed, then install this
update right over the top of it.  Make sure you rebuild the Component
library with the updated VCLs included with this release.


This is a complete release, so you DO NOT need to have any prior   
version before installing this release.


  IMPORTANT NOTE FOR C++ BUILDER (BCB) DEVELOPERS
  -----------------------------------------------
  This package only has the Delphi files.  Get this archive for the
  BCB files:  DZ-BCB160.ZIP  from these web pages:
  http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Network/2114/zipbeta.html
  

This ZIP should go into a base directory of \ZipBeta.


IMPORTANT!
----------
You need to copy the redistributable modules to your desired
directory on your development computer.  

Copy \ZipBeta\DLL\*.DLL to your Windows System directory.
Copy \ZipBeta\SFX\*.BIN to your Windows System directory.


Unsupported Properties
----------------------
Since I normally use the latest Delphi release, sometimes new properties
of Delphi's VCLs will get saved with DFM files.  Please tell it to
"Ignore" and "Property not found" type of error you may see.


Installation
------------

This is one of the biggest freeware software releases for Delphi and
C++ Builder.  To get going quickly and correctly, please follow these
instructions.  Read them over once before starting.  If you don't
understand a step, get help before you start the install!


1. You MUST install this package on a computer that has Delphi (any 
   version from 2 thru 6).

2. The VCLs included with this release are:
      TZipMaster - the main ZIP support VCL
      TSortGrid  - a very handy descendant from TStringGrid

    The files required to support these VCLs are located in the
    VCL subdirectory.  You have two choices for how to proceed
    (option A is recommended):

      A) add the directory C:\ZipBeta\VCL to your VCL search path
         IMPORTANT! If you have the non-beta C:\ZIP\VCL path on
         your system, you should remove it from the search path.
                             or
      B) copy the files in C:\ZipBeta\VCL to another directory already
         in your VCL search path

    If you want to use option A, the instructions for this are
    included below.  If you want option B, then please copy those
    files now.
  

3.  Install the VCLs       

    This procedure will install the VCLs into the IDE.  After
    this, you will be able to see them on the "Samples" tab.

    Delphi 2:
      a) Close any Files or Projects that are open.
      b) Select the "Component...Install" choice.
      c) If you want to add C:\ZipBeta\VCL to the library search
         path, you may do it now using the second edit box.

      d) Click on the Add button.  
      e) Enter the path and filename of where the ZIPMSTR.PAS 
         file is located, or find it now with Browse. 

      f) Click on the Add button.  
      g) Enter the path and filename of where the SORTGRID.PAS 
         file is located, or find it now with Browse. 

      h) Click on OK.  The component library will rebuilt.


    Delphi 3:
      These instructions assume you will place the VCLs into
      the standard user package "DCLUSR30.DPK".  Advanced 
      developers may want to use a different package, or to
      make a new package.  Packages can be confusing, so I will
      only document the simplest case, of putting them into 
      "DCLUSR30.DPK", which will work fine for most developers.
 
      a) Close any Files or Projects that are open.
      b) Select the "Component, Install Component" choice. Make
         sure the "Into existing package" tab is selected.
      c) Check to see if package: "DCLUSR30.DPK" is already 
         selected.  If not, you should now locate "dclusr30.dpk".
      d) Add the C:\ZIP\VCL directory to the search path
         box (unless you copied the files to a path already
         in the search path).

      e) In the Unit name block, enter ZIPMSTR.PAS. Click OK.
      f) It will ask if you want to rebuild the Component Library.
         ANSWER NO (saves time to do it only 1 time later).

      g) Click on Add.
      h) In the Unit name block, enter SORTGRID.PAS. Click OK.

      i) Click on "Compile" to rebuild the Component Library.
         If it does not automatically install the new VCLs to the
         component palette, then click on the "install" button of
         the package option dialog box.

      j) When done, close the package option dialog box by
         clicking on it's upper right corner.  Say "Yes" to
         keep the changes.

    Delphi 4, 5, and 6:
      Here's some new instructions that will install into a new package.

      1) Menu | Component | Install Component...
        a) Tab->Into New package
        b)   Package file name:   ZipMaster
        c)   Package description: Freeware Zip and Unzip package
        d)   Unit Filename:  Choose Browse and select SortGrid.pas
                             from the directory where you put it in.
        e)   Click Ok

     ( Message "ZipMaster.bpl will be built then installed", Continue )

     2) Click No

     3) Menu |Comoponent | Install Component...
        a) Tab->Into Existing package
        b)   Unit Filename:  Choose Browse and select ZipMstr.pas
                             from the directory where you put it in.
        c)   Click Ok

    ( Message "ZipMaster.bpl will be built then installed", Continue )

     4) Click Yes

       After the compilation a message should popup that TSortGrid and 
       TZipMaster have been installed and registered.

     You will get 4 warnings about implicit imported units. This is not
     a problem you can and may ignore them.  If you like, you can add the
     units ZipDll.pas, UnzDll.pas, ZCallBck.pas and ZipMsg.pas to this
     package to eliminate the warnings.


                      DELPHI 3 HELP INSTALLATION

(there is no Delphi 2 integrated help, but you can double-click on the .hlp
file from Explorer to see it)
[Or build a .kwf file, for this you need the .rtf source file which is also
 available on one of our websites.]

(for Delphi4, just change 3 to 4 in these instructions)

1) Make sure Delphi is NOT running now.

2) Copy ZipMstr.hlp and ZipMstr.cnt from \ZipBeta\help
   to Delphi 3's help subdirectory.

3) In Delphi 3's Help subdirectory, edit Delphi3.cnt and add the
   following two lines (add each one to the appropriate section in
   that small file):

:Index ZipMaster Component Help=ZipMstr.hlp
:include ZipMstr.cnt

4) In Delphi 3's Help subdirectory, delete the old 
   DELPHI3.GID and DELPHI3.FTS files.  This can be done easily 
   from Explorer.  Make sure Delphi is NOT running when you do 
   this. If you want to do it from an MS-DOS prompt, 
   you may need to un-hide them first:
      C>attrib -r -h -s delphi3.gid 
      C>del delphi3.gid
      C>attrib -r -h -s delphi3.fts 
      C>del delphi3.fts

5) The next time you use Delphi's Help feature, it'll say
   "preparing help file for first use".  This is when it is
   rebuilding the .GID file to include the new Help topics.
   The next time you do a full text search in Help, it'll 
   rebuild DELPHI3.FTS.  


                            DELPHI DEMO

   NOTE: You should have the compiler option "break on exception"
   turned off because the demos that use the SortGrid VCL use 
   exceptions to determine datatypes.  This is only a concern 
   when running the demo programs from the IDE.

1.  From the IDE, open the project C:\ZipBeta\Demo1\ZipDemo1.DPR.

    Examine the forms and decide if you need to resize any of
    the controls, or change the position of anything. This is
    sometimes necessary if I developed the forms at a different
    screen resolution than you are using.

    The demo1 program is a fairly straight-forward example
    of what you can do with this package!  Everything revolves
    around the TSortGrid, which always shows you the contents 
    of your ZIP archive.  Use right-click on a column header to
    do an descending sort, or a left-click for an ascending sort.
 

7.  There is a new requirement for programs that you write.  We have
    put most of our error messages put into a resource file.  You
    need to add the desired resource file to your project file.
    Simply add a line like this to your project file:

       {$R ZipMsgUS.res}

    You can see how this was done by checking Demo1's .DPR file.
    The beta release only suppports US / English:

       ZipMsgUS.res - US / English
       

                  Deployment of Your Programs

Any program you write using this package will require the two 
DLLs: ZIPDLL.DLL and UNZDLL.DLL to be present of each user's
hard disk.  You should have your install procedures put these
files into the WINDOWS SYSTEM directory (which is named differently
on some systems - especially WinNT systems).  If that isn't 
possible, then you should put them into the same directory as 
your .EXE program that uses them.

Also, the ZipSFX.BIN module must be installed into the same
directory as the DLLs.  This module is only needed if your
application program needs to make .EXE archives.

IMPORTANT: Any .EXE archives you make with this package do
NOT need any supporting files on the end-user's computer!
This is very handy!

Of course, there are no distribution fees for the DLLs, or
any other part of the package.  This whole package is 
freeware, but does have some minor distribution restrictions
(mainly that you can't profit from the ZIP DLLs, and you need
to document where users can get source code).  Please see 
README.TXT for these restrictions.

See README.TXT for more general information about this release,
and also check out the DOC subdirectory.
