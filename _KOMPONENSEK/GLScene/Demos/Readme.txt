Samples + Compiled EXE for GLScene v0.8 wip 4

Included are VCL50.BPL and GLSCENE5.BPL files that should be placed in your Windows\System or WinNT\System32 directory.

If you own a copy of Delphi 5 or 4, you don't need this archive, as all samples are included in the standard (source only) GLScene package.

These samples may not be a great piece of eye candy, but have a look at the .pas file, and you will see that very little code is needed to achieve simple tasks.

Enjoy :)
